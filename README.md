# DecisionTree

Sample decision tree algorithms (ID3, C4.5) implementation in python inspired by different github-powered repositories (mainly https://github.com/barisesmer/C4.5) and scikit-learn-contrib

Work is still in progress; some useful features are still TBD, README is non-informative, code is dirty and far from ideal. 
Anyway, it pretends to work. 
Sample interface call is inside examples/simple.py
